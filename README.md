# Messaging App
Messaging App is my first Full Stack application that I made teaching myself the basics of react before I attended Rutgers Coding Bootcamp.  

This app is a full stack app using React, Node, Express, Knex, Postgres, cors, as well as using socket.io for real time messages.    This is the repo for the back-end code deployed on Heroku. The repo for the [front-end code](https://github.com/bthalpin/messagingApp) is deployed on GitHub pages.
